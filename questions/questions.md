*Question 1*

Subject:  Bad design  

Hello,  

Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear, but I really hate the new dashboard design. Clearing and deleting indexes are now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating, so this is inconvenient.  

Thanks,  
Marissa  

Hey Marissa,

Sorry to hear that, we know that sometimes changes are not well received by some of our clients,
but changes are sometimes necessary to make the product evolves in a good way.
Our goal is to give you a powerful tool for your day to day use through a user friendly interface,
we have spent quite some time with the product team, gathering feedback from a pool of users to give you this new iteration.
By the way are you aware of what you can do now thanks to this new update?
Do you have free time slot this week? Would be glad to show you what we have done.
In the meantime, could you please also list to me what you don't like at the moment?

Regards,
Christophe

*Question 2*:   

From: carrie@coffee.com  
Subject: URGENT ISSUE WITH PRODUCTION!!!!  

Since today 9:15am we have been seeing a lot of errors on our website. Multiple users have reported that they were unable to publish their feedbacks and that an alert box with "Record is too big, please contact enterprise@algolia.com".  

Our website is an imdb like website where users can post reviews of coffee shops online. Along with that we enrich every record with a lot of metadata that is not for search. I am already a paying customer of your service, what else do you need to make your search work?  

Please advise on how to fix this. Thanks.   

Hi Carrie,

Hope you are doing fine, could you please give me more details?
It seems like you are adding a lot of data which are not related to the search, unfortunately, this might cause the issue
could you please run a test without adding the metadata and get back to me?

Kind regards,
Christophe

Hi, my website is not working and here's the error:  

![error message](./error.png)  

Can you fix it please?  

Hi Marc,

It seems like you have an issue with your searchkit library, could you please make sure that you are importing the library
into your code, because the code doesn't find it.
Could you please do the modification and let me know if it works better?

Kin regards,
